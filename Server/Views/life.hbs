   <div class="bio">
    <h3>Shridhara Pavel R U - Bio</h3>
    <p><i>"There are no miracle people. It happens they get interested in this thing and they learn all this stuff, but they're just people."</i> â€” Richard Feynman</p>
    <p>For much of my life, I wasn't considered impressive. Many saw me as someone who couldn't study or achieve much. But Feynman's words, along with the support and criticism of many people, pushed me to prove otherwise. I don't seek to be considered a genius, but I do strive to stand on the same platform as them, not by innate talent, but by sheer hard work and passion. My goal is to surpass industry leaders and geniuses, not because I'm extraordinary, but because I refuse to stop trying.</p>
</div>

<div class="background">
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>My father is a leading lawyer and a social reformist. He never tolerated discrimination, standing firm in his beliefs and maintaining a reputation for integrity. As a positive social reformist, he has faced numerous challenges, including arrests and blackmarks, yet his unwavering resolve and straightforward nature have always inspired me. His badass approach to life has deeply influenced my ideology and passion.</p>
    <p>My mother, a genius with PhD-level knowledge in three distinct fields, is a beacon of wisdom and intellect. Her dedication to learning and her multifaceted expertise have always been a source of inspiration. Together, the values they've instilled in me drive my ambition to reach new heights and help others achieve their own dreams. I aspire to fly the highest, carrying their legacy forward by contributing positively to the world and empowering those who wish to soar.</p>
</div>

<div class="what-ai">
    <h3>What Makes AI So Interesting That It Gets Me Outta Bed Everyday?</h3>
    <p>AI captivates me not because it's at the forefront of innovation, but because of its potential to transform civilization. In a world increasingly consumed by wars, global issues, and controversies, AI represents a beacon of hope. Ever since I learned about the singularity, I've been fascinated by the idea of harnessing AI to solve world hunger, drive space exploration, and create a society where people are free to pursue their passions without the burden of economic survival. I envision a future where AI alleviates the need for mundane work, allowing humanity to focus on creativity, growth, and fulfillment. My goal is to pioneer and contribute to this future, ensuring AI is developed and used for the betterment of all. Even if I cannot personally initiate the singularity, I am determined to leave behind a legacy that will propel its development for positive and transformative purposes.</p>
