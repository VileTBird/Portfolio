        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p><i>"There are no miracle people. It happens they get interested in this thing and they learn all this stuff, but they're just people."</i> — Richard Feynman</p>
        <p>For much of my life, I wasn't considered impressive. Many saw me as someone who couldn't study or achieve much. But Feynman's words, along with the support and criticism of many people, pushed me to prove otherwise. I don't seek to be considered a genius, but I do strive to stand on the same platform as them, not by innate talent, but by sheer hard work and passion. My goal is to surpass industry leaders and geniuses, not because I'm extraordinary, but because I refuse to stop trying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="background life-section">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>My dad’s a leading lawyer and a social reformer. He’s never put up with any kind of discrimination, always standing by what he believes in and maintaining a solid reputation. He’s faced a lot of challenges due to his ideologies, including getting arrested due to setups and dealing with other tough situations, but his unshakable attitude and straightforward way of doing things in law have always inspired me.</p>
        <p>My mom is incredibly smart, with knowledge/phd level degrees in three different fields and she is a really kind person. Together, they’ve taught me values that drive me to aim high and help others reach their goals too. I want to keep pushing forward, carrying on their legacy by realising my ambitions one day and helping others achieve their dreams.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="what-ai life-section">
        <h3>What Makes AI So Interesting That It Gets Me Outta Bed Everyday?</h3>
        <p>AI isn’t just fascinating because terminators are cool; it drives me because of its potential to change the world. With all the wars, global problems, and controversies we’re facing, AI feels like a real shot at hope. Since I first heard about the singularity, I’ve been hooked on the idea of using AI to solve humanity's unsolved problems in science & society, like world hunger, human space exploration, and creating a society where people can chase their passions without worrying about making ends meet or economic survival. I see a future where AI takes over the boring, repetitive work, giving us more time to be creative, enjoy life, and continue evolving. My goal is to start the singularity one way or another. Even if I can’t be the one to kick it off, I’m deadset on leaving behind a legacy that drives AI’s development for the betterment of humanity.</p>

    <div class="what-ai life-section">
        <h3>Where do I see myself in 10 years?</h3>
        <p>Honestly, that's a tough question to answer, but not for the reasons you might think. Passions change, and I don't really believe in sticking to just one thing forever. There are no right or wrong choices in life just different choices. Maybe someday I'll decide to focus on family and relationships instead of startups or research—who knows? I can't say for sure, but what I do know is that I love what I'm doing now, and I want to achieve something <i>great</i>, whatever that ends up being. <i>Great</i> could mean revolutionizing AI, or it could mean being the best father, son, or brother. Either way, I'm going all in. It's either go big or go home.</p>
