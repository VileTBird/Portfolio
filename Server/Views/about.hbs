    <h1>{{title}} Me</h1>
    <p>My full name is Shridhara Pavel R U. I'm a Computer Science Student at Lakehead University. I'm on my second year and I love to code.</p>
    <p>The only thing I like more than Coding is Math, Especially the math behind the universe. As of right now I'm focused on data science & Machine learning. The math behind it all is fascinating, how people apply statistics to predict future outcomes.</p>
    <p>I also like to venture into game dev, simulation, and pure mathematical concepts that govern the universe. I make ml models in my free time to improve my skills and I have 2 main projects I'm working on right now.</p>

            <h2>Project Craft</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/kaushik-1112">Partner: Kaushik A R</a>
            <p>Asset Ez is an Asset generator for game devs to improve their workflow and make their lives easier. Im unfortunately unable to talk 
                more about the project to preserve intergrity, but a more detailed description will be out after its initial release!

            <h2>Project Siren</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/kaushik-1112">Partner: Kaushik A R</a>
            <p>This is more of an experimental project to help law enforcement flag dangerous individuals to monitor them and predict these said individuals
                future plans. As I said experimental.

            <h2>Project Success</h2>
            <p>Children nowadays are often restricted from reaching their true potential, and they have little control over it due to various factors such as bullying in school, poor parenting, or endangerment at home. These factors significantly influence a child's future trajectory, potentially leading to an unfulfilled life. My service is a survey site that utilizes an ML model to predict the extent to which a child's future might be affected, and it provides a list of potential causes along with suggested fixes.
            </p>
            <p>With this technology we can improve childhoods, potentially help them mature into healthy adults and ensure their future Success.</p>
