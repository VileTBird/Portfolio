    <h1>{{title}} Me</h1>
    <p>My full name is Shridhar Pavel. I'm a Computer Science Student at Lakehead University. I'm on my second year and I love to code.</p>
    <p>The only thing I like more than Coding is Math, Especially the math behind the universe. As of right now I'm focused on data science & Machine learning. The math behind it all is fascinating, how people apply statistics to predict future outcomes.</p>
    <p>I also like to venture into game dev, simulation, and pure mathematical concepts that govern the universe like logistic map, chaos theory and some more fascinating concepts. I make ml models in my free time to improve my skills and I have 3 main projects I'm working on right now.</p>

    <ul class="row card-group">
        <li class="card m-4 text-center col-lg-4">
            <h2>Project Craft</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/kaushik-1112">Partner: Kaushik A R</a>
            <p>Project Craft is an Asset generator for game devs to improve their workflow and make their lives easier. Im unfortunately unable to talk 
                more about the project to preserve intergrity, but a more detailed description will be out after its initial release!
            </p>

            <p>
                I'll be collabing with an experienced and talented dev/close friend for this project checkout his github using the link on this card.

            <h2>Project Siren</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/kaushik-1112">Partner: Kaushik A R</a>
            <p>This is more of an experimental project to help law enforcement flag dangerous individuals to monitor them and predict these said individuals
                future plans. This will use multiple algorithms to map multiple flags to a single representation + predicting the suspects crime.

            <h2>Project Success</h2>
            <a href="/media">Solo Project</a>
            <p>My service uses a survey and machine learning to predict how factors like bullying, parenting, and home environment might impact a child's future, and provides a list of potential causes plus helps by offering solutions for potential issues.
            </p>
            <p>With this technology we can improve childhoods, potentially help them mature into healthy adults and ensure their future Success.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>My big dream is to use my passion for math and coding to make a huge positive impact on the world, akin to the future impact I hope Project Success will have, but even bigger.</p>
